To create a screen pet with Python, we need to know what it is and what it does. When you launch the program, the Screen Pet will be sitting there, with a small smile on its face and blinking. We’ll code our program to change the onscreen animal’s expressions from normal to happy, cheeky, or sad, depending on how you interact with it onscreen. 

Below are the three features that our screen pet will perform:

i.	Happy Face: When you will click on it with the mouse the screen pet will blush and it will look happy.

ii.	Cheeky Face: If you will double click it, then it will show its tongue to you.

iii.	Sad Face: If you will ignore it then it will become sad and the point where you click then it will become happy again.

Screen Pet game is an event-based program, which means the functions it performs and the order in which it performs all functions is dependent on user input. In such programs, user input can take any form, such as keypresses and mouse clicks.
